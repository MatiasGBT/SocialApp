# SocialApp
(In process) Social network made with Angular, Spring Boot (Java), Keycloak and MySQL.
## Deployment
***Important note:** At the moment the app starts in developer mode and is not adapted for production.*  

The application can be deployed using a single command thanks to Docker.  
First of all, download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) if you don't have it installed locally. 

Then you have to clone this repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/MatiasGBT/SocialApp.git`  
or download it as a ZIP file.

After that, you will be able to deploy this app running the following command in
the repository folder:  
`docker compose up`  
You will need to have Docker Desktop open and running when yo execute this command (and any other Docker command).


The first time you run the application it will be slow because Docker needs to download and build the images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
You will be able to know when the project is ready when all the containers compile correctly. You will see the next lines in log of each container:
#### backend:  
`SocialAppApiApplication: Started SocialAppApiApplication in 42.05 seconds (JVM running for 69.204)`
#### frontend:  
`âœ” Compiled successfully.`
#### mysql:  
`/usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections. Version: '8.0.30'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server - GPL.`
#### keycloak:  
`Running the server in development mode. DO NOT use this configuration in production.`  

*Note: You can see the log of each container clicking on their names on Docker Desktop*

When all the containers are built, you will be able to open the application by putting `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.
